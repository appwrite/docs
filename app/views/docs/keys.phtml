<p>Using your API Keys, you can access Appwrite services using the SDK of your choice. To create a new API key, go to
    your API keys tab in your project setting using your Appwrite console and click the 'Add API Key' button.</p>

<p>When adding a new API Key, you can choose which permission scope to grant your application. It is a best practice to
    allow only the permissions you need to meet your project goals.</p>

<p>If you need to replace your API Key, create a new key, update your app credentials and, once ready, delete your old
    key.</p>
