<p>Appwrite permission mechanism offers a simple and yet flexible way to manage which users, teams, or roles can access a specific resource of your project, like documents and files.</p>

<p>Using permissions, you can decide that only <span class="tag">user A</span> and <span class="tag">user B</span> will have read access to a specific database document, while <span class="tag">user C</span> and <span class="tag">team X</span> will be the only ones with write access.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, read permission will allow users and teams to view a resource while with write permission, they will be able to both update or delete it.</p>

<p>Read and write permissions can be given to specific users, entire teams, or only to a particular group of role members inside a team.</p>

<p>A project user can only grant a resource with permissions he or she owns. For example, if a user is trying to share a document with a team, he or she are not members of, they will encounter a 401 not authorized error.</p>

    <h4>Appwrite Resource</h4>
    
    <p>An Appwrite resource can be a database collection, database document, or a storage file. Each resource has both read and write permissions to define who can access it.</p>
    
    <p>Using the Appwrite permissions mechanism, you can share resources between users, teams, and members with different roles.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="default-values"><a href="/docs/permissions#default-values">Default Values</a></h2>

<p>When not providing a resource with read or write permissions, the default value will be empty. When a read or write permissions is missing, no one will be granted access control to the resource.</p>

<div class="notice calm margin-top-large margin-bottom-large">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    
    <p>You will need an active session to handle database transactions for your collections.</p>
    <p>If you have rules where you allow for wild cards or role:guest in a collection, you can create an Anonymous Session before you make the API call.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="server-integration"><a href="/docs/permissions#server-integration">Server Integration</a></h2>

<p>A server or <a href="/docs/admin" target="_blank">admin integration</a> can be used for increased flexibility. When using a server integration in combination with the proper <a href="/docs/keys#scopes" target="_blank">API scopes</a>, you can have both read and write access to any of your project resources regardless of their permissions.</p>

<p>Using the server integration flexibility, you can change resource permissions, share resources between different users and teams, or edit and delete them without any limitations.</p>

<h2 id="examples"><a href="/docs/permissions#examples">Examples</a></h2>

<p>The examples below will show you how you can use the different Appwrite permissions to manage access control to your project resources.</p>

<p>The following examples are using the <a href="https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appwrite Web SDK</a> but can be applied similarly to any of the other <a href="/docs/sdks">Appwrite SDKs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example-1"><a href="/docs/permissions#example-1">Example #1 - Basic Usage</a></h3>

<p>In the following example, we are creating a document that can be read by everyone and only be edited, or deleted by a user with a UID <span class="tag">user:5c1f88b42259e</span>.</p>

<div class="ide" data-lang="javascript" data-lang-label="Web SDK">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-javascript" data-prism>import { Client, Databases } from "appwrite";
        
const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1')
    .setProject('[PROJECT_ID]');

const database = new Databases(client, '[DATABASE_ID]');

let promise = database.createDocument(
    '[COLLECTION_ID]',
    {'actorName': 'Chris Evans', 'height': 183},
    ['role:all'], // Anyone can view this document
    ['user:5c1f88b42259e'] // You can only grant permissions you own, this must be the current user UID
);

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});

</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="example-2"><a href="/docs/permissions#example-2">Example #2 - Team Roles</a></h3>

<p>In the following example, we are creating a document that can be read-only by members of <span class="tag">team:5c1f88b87435e</span> and can only be edited, or deleted by members of the same team that possesses the role <span class="tag">owner</span>.</p>

<div class="ide" data-lang="javascript" data-lang-label="Web SDK">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-javascript" data-prism>import { Client, Databases } from "appwrite";

    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1')
    .setProject('[PROJECT_ID]');

const database = new Databases(client, '[DATABASE_ID]');

let promise = database.createDocument(
    '[COLLECTION_ID]',
    {'actorName': 'Chris Evans', 'height': 183},
    ['team:5c1f88b87435e'], // The user must be a team member to grant this permission
    ['team:5c1f88b87435e/owner']); // The user must be a team owner to grant this permission

<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

<p>Appwrite currently has 6 different roles aimed to handle access control to specific API endpoints or entire services.</p>

<p>You can review Appwrite API references to see which role is needed in order to gain access to a specific API endpoint or service.</p>

<p>For example, only users with a guest role can access authentication endpoints while access to member users is denied.</p>

<p>You can change your project members' roles from your project settings in the Appwrite console.</p>
