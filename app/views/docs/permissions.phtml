<p>Appwrite permission mechanism offers a simple, yet flexible way to manage which users, teams, or roles can access a specific resource in your project, like documents and files.</p>

<p>Using permissions, you can decide that only <span class="tag">user A</span> and <span class="tag">user B</span> will have read and update access to a specific database document, while <span class="tag">user C</span> and <span class="tag">team X</span> will be the only ones with delete access.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, read permission allows a user to read a resource, create allows users to create new resources, update allows a user to make changes to a resource, and delete allows the user to remove the resource.</p>

<p>All permissions can be granted to individuals or groups of users, entire teams, or only to team members with a specific role. Permission can also be granted based on authentication status such as to all users, only authenticated users, or only guest users.</p>

<p>A project user can only grant a resource with permissions that they own. For example, if a user is trying to share a document with a team that they are not a member of, they will encounter a 401 not authorized error. If your app needs users to grant access to teams they're not a member of, you can create Appwrite Functions with a <a href="/docs/getting-started-for-server">Server SDK</a> to achieve this functionality.</p>

<div class="notice calm margin-top-large margin-bottom-large">
    <h4>Appwrite Resource</h4>
    
    <p>An Appwrite resource can be a database, collection, document, bucket, or file. Each resource has its own set of permissions to define who can interact with it.</p>

    <p>Using the Appwrite permissions mechanism, you can grant resource access to users, teams, and members with different roles.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="default-values"><a href="/docs/permissions#default-values">Default Values</a></h2>

<p>When not providing a resource with read or write permissions, the default value will be empty. When a read or write permissions is missing, no one will be granted access control to the resource.</p>

<h2 id="server-integration"><a href="/docs/permissions#server-integration">Server Integration</a></h2>

<p>Server integrations can be used for increased flexibility. When using a Server SDK in combination with the proper <a href="/docs/keys#scopes">API key scopes</a>, you can have any type of access to any of your project resources regardless of their permissions.</p>

<p>Using the server integration flexibility, you can change resource permissions, share resources between different users and teams, or edit and delete them without any limitations.</p>

<h2 id="examples"><a href="/docs/permissions#examples">Examples</a></h2>

<p>The examples below will show you how you can use the different Appwrite permissions to manage access control to your project resources.</p>

<p>The following examples are using the <a href="https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appwrite Web SDK</a> but can be applied similarly to any of the other <a href="/docs/sdks">Appwrite SDKs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example-1"><a href="/docs/permissions#example-1">Example #1 - Basic Usage</a></h3>

<p>In the following example, we are creating a document that can be read by anyone, edited by writers or admins, and deleted by administrators or a user with the user ID <span class="tag">user:5c1f88b42259e</span>.</p>

<div class="ide" data-lang="javascript" data-lang-label="Web SDK">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-javascript" data-prism>import { Client, Databases, Permission, Role } from "appwrite";
        
const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint('https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1')
    .setProject('[PROJECT_ID]');

const databases = new Databases(client);

let promise = databases.createDocument(
    '[DATABASE_ID]',
    '[COLLECTION_ID]',
    {'actorName': 'Chris Evans', 'height': 183},

        Permission.read(Role.any()),                  // Anyone can view this document
        Permission.update(Role.team("writers")),      // Writers can update this document
        Permission.update(Role.team("admin")),       // Admins can update this document

        Permission.delete(Role.team("admin"))         // Admins can delete this document
    ]
);

promise.then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
}, function (error) {
    console.log(error);
});</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="example-2"><a href="/docs/permissions#example-2">Example #2 - Team Roles</a></h3>

<p>In the following example, we are creating a document that can be read by members of the team with ID <span class="tag">5c1f88b87435e</span> and can only be edited or deleted by members of the same team that possess the team role <span class="tag">owner</span>.</p>
