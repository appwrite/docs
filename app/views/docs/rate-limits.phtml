<p>Some of Appwrite's API endpoints have a rate limit to avoid abuse or brute-force attack against Appwrite's REST API.
    Each Appwrite route documentation has information about any rate limits that might apply to him.</p>

<p>You can check the returned HTTP headers of any API request to see your current rate limit status:</p>

<div class="ide">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-http" data-prism>HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2013 17:27:06 GMT
Status: 200
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The headers tell you everything you need to know about your current rate limit status:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" class="full text-size-small">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 180px">Header</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>X-RateLimit-Limit</td>
            <td>The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-RateLimit-Remaining</td>
            <td>The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X-RateLimit-Reset</td>
            <td>The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you need the time in a different format, any modern programming language can get the job done. For example, if you
    open up the console on your web browser, you can easily get the reset time as a JavaScript Date object, You can also

<div class="ide">
    <pre
        class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-javascript" data-prism>new Date(1372700873 * 1000) // => Mon Jul 01 2013 13:47:53 GMT-0400 (EDT)</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once you go over the rate limit you will receive an error response:</p>

<div class="ide">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-http" data-prism>HTTP/1.1 429
Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:50:41 GMT
Status: 429
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1377013266
{
    "message": "Too many requests",
    "code": 429
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2><a href="/docs/rate-limits#abuse" id="abuse">Service Abuse</a></h2>

<p>To protect the quality of service from Appwrite, additional rate limits may apply to some actions. For example,
    rapidly creating content, polling aggressively instead of using webhooks, making API calls with a high concurrency,
    or repeatedly requesting data that is computationally expensive may result in abuse rate limiting.</p>

<p>It is not intended for this rate limit to interfere with any legitimate use of the API. Your normal rate limits
    should be the only limit you target.</p>

<p>If you are exceeding your rate limit, you can likely fix the issue by caching API responses and using webhooks for
    data polling.</p>

<p>If your application triggers this rate limit, you'll receive an informative response:</p>

<div class="ide">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-http" data-prism>HTTP/1.1 429
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: close
{
    "message": "Too many login attempts",
    "code": 429
