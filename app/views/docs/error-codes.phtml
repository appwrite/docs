<p>Appwrite uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid input, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with the Appwrite server, but these are rare.</p>

<p>When the Appwrite APIs return error messages, it does so in JSON format. For example, an error might look like this:</p>

<div class="ide">
    <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="prism language-javascript" data-prism>{
    "message": "Invalid id: Parameter must be a valid number",
    "code": 400
}
</code></pre>
</div>
