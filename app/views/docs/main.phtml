    <p class="margin-bottom">Welcome to our documentation section. Here you will be able to find quick guides to setup
        and integrate with Appwrite on your platform of choice. You can also review full and detailed API references to
        all of our services, tools, and features.</p>

    <h2 class="margin-bottom">Overview</h2>

    <p>Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server that is aiming to abstract the complexity of common, complex, and
        repetitive tasks required for building a modern app.</p>

    <p>Appwrite provides you with a set of APIs, tools, and a management console UI to help you build your apps a lot
        faster and in a much more secure way. Between Appwrite different services, you can find user authentication and
        account management, user preferences, database and storage persistence, cloud functions, localization, image
        manipulation, scheduled background tasks, and more.</p>

    <p>Appwrite is both cross-platform and technology agnostic, meaning it can run on any operating system, coding
        language, framework, or platform. Although Appwrite can easily fit the definition of a serverless technology,
        it's designed to run well in multiple configurations. You can integrate Appwrite directly with your client app,
        use it behind your custom backend or alongside your custom backend server.</p>
