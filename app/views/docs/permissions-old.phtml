<p>The Appwrite API roles and permissions allow you to manage read and write access across your app different resources
    such as database documents and storage files.</p>

<p>While roles define access to entire services or API endpoints, permissions are used to manage read and write access
    to specific resources such as database documents or storage files.</p>

<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

<p>Appwrite currently has 6 different roles aimed to handle access control to specific API endpoints or entire services.
</p>

<p>You can review Appwrite API references to see which role is needed in order to gain access to a specific API endpoint
    or service.</p>

<p>For example, only users with a guest role can access authentication endpoints while access to member users is denied.
</p>

<p>You can change your project members' roles from your project settings in the Appwrite console.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Permissions</h2>

<p>Appwrite permissions are more specific than its roles. Permissions are aimed to help you manage read and write access
    control to specific resource rather than entire endpoints or services.</p>

<p>Using permissions you can decide that only users X and Y will have read access to a specific database document, while
    user Z will be the only one with write access.</p>

<p>Permission can be given to specific users, entire teams or only to a specific group of users inside a team.</p>
