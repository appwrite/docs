### Terminology
Appwrite has many services and features. Our word choices must be consistent across the many documentation pages to communicate clearly and precisely. 

#### General
| **Term**      | **Suggested Usage**                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Appwrite      | Written as "Appwrite" rather than "AppWrite" or "appwrite".                      |
| Projects      | Each Appwrite instance can have many Appwrite Projects. Use "Appwrite Projects" as a proper noun when referring to the concept, use project or projects when referring to specific projects.                      |
| Appwrite Dashboard | Refers to the the web GUI. Can be referred to as "dashboard" in short, when contextual confusion is not a problem. |
| Dashboard Users | Refers to users that are registered to have access to the Appwrite Dashboard. Not a proper noun, use as "a dashboard user" or "the dashboard user". Differenciate this clearly from users created through a Client SDK. |
| Client SDK    | Refers to SDKs used by Web, Flutter, Android, and Apple applications. Use as a proper noun, use "a Client SDK" or "the Client SDKs", not client-side SDKs.                                                        |
| Server SDK    | Refers to SDKs used by backend languages like Java, Node.js, or PHP. Use as a proper noun, use "a Server SDK" or "the Server SDKs", not server-side SDKs.                                                         |
| Adapter       | Refers to interfaces used to connect Appwrite with third party technologies. Adapters are found for OAuth, Databases, Storage, and error logging. When referring to adapters, use specific adapter names, such as "a Database adapter" or "a Storage adapter" to avoid confusion.|
| Developer     | Refers to Appwrite developers that use Appwrite to create applications.                                                                                                                                           |
| End User      | Refers to end users of applications with an Appwrite backend. This doesn't refer to developers that interact with Appwrite directly.   |
| Appwrite Instance | Refers to a single, self-hosted deployment of Appwrite. Use as "an Appwrite instance" or "Appwrite instances".|
| Application   | Refers to the application built by the Appwrite developer. Can be referred to as web app, mobile app, flutter app, etc. |
| Usage Stats   | Refers to the analytics collected for select services and displayed on the Appwrite Dashboard. |

| Authentication Service | The Authentication Service is composed of the Account API, Users API, and Teams API.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Account API            | The Account API is an API under the Authentication Service that is used by Client SDKs. Avoid "Account Service" to avoid confusing developers that it is different from the "Users API" because it might imply they are separate services.                    |
| Users API              | The Users API is an API under the Authentication Service that is used by Server SDKs. Avoid "Users Service" to avoid confusing developers that it is accessing users different from the "Account API" because it might imply they are separate services.       |
| Teams API              | The Teams API is an API under the Authentication Service that is used to organize created accounts. Avoid "Teams Service", because it is not a stand alone service.                                                                                           |

| Register            | Use "create account" where relevant, and use register/sign up to refer to actions on a frontend application.                                                                |

| Create                | When we "create" a function, it refers to the process of using "Add Function" on the dashboard or using `functions.create()` method. No code is uploaded.                         |
| Deploy/Deployment     | When we say we "deploy" a function or create a new deployment, this is when we upload code through the Create Deployment button or endpoint.                                |
| Activate Deployment   | When we enable a particular version of a function, we say we "activate" the deployment.                                                                                     |
